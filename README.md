Verivox Code challenge
=====================

This repository contains my implementation of the verivox code challenge in .NET Core.

Pre-requisites
==============
You will need [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed to run the project locally, or [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to run the container.

Run
======
To run simply run `dotnet run` at the command line inside the `ProductsService` directory.
Alternatively you can use `docker-compose up` to build and run the container.

In either scenario you can access the service at `http://localhost:5000`.
